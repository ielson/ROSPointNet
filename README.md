# ROSPointNet

This repository aims to run PointNet as a node for segmenting and classifying point cloud generated by a Lidar in ROS in a `sensor_msgs/PointCloud` format.

## Installation

First initiate your virtual environment:

`$ python3 -m venv rospointnet`

Activate virtual environment:

`$ source rospointnet/bin/activate`

Install required packages:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Working with offline simulated Point Clouds

Refer to this [README in order to work with simulated point clouds](https://github.com/ielson/ROSPointNet/blob/ros-integration/OfflineSimulatedPointClouds.md). A snapshot from the simulated world in Gazebo from [LaR Laboratory](https://github.com/ericksuzart/lar_gazebo) was taken and can be found in [here](https://github.com/ielson/ROSPointNet/blob/ros-integration/test_data/simulated_laboratory.pcd).
